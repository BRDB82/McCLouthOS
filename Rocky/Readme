McClouth OS (Built on Rocky)
----------------------------

Two variants will be available:
  * Server: codename Njord
  * Workstation: codename Skadi (for future release)

mcclouth-base-install.sh will install a base system, and will in turn use mcclouth-setup to do the installation for the machine, and if already installed, it can be used to add services or remove services etc.
mcclouth-base-install.sh is support EFI. If your system doesn't have EFI, you can try mcclouth-base-install-bios.sh.
